We need to determine the cycle index group $S_n^{(2)}$, where $S_n^{(2)}$ is the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the set of 2-element subsets of a graph of $n$ vertices. First, determine the number of permutations of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ of each type and show that the type of a 2-set permutation of $X$ depends only on the type of $f$ as a permutation of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.)

We need to obtain the cycle index of the group $S_5^{(2)}$ of permutations of the set $X$ of 10 unordered pairs of distinct integers from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (the possible edges of a graph of order 5). First, compute the number of permutations $f$ of $S_5$ of each type. Then use the fact that the type of $f$ as a permutation of $X$ depends only on the type of $f$ as a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.)
